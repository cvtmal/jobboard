# Styling & UI
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use Shadcn UI for components.
- If you need to use something else than Shadcn UI, you can do that, but ask me first.

# Inertia.js
- Stick to the Inertia.js documentation for best practices.
- Use Inertia.js for Data Fetching, Forms, File uploads, Links, Validation, Scroll Management etc.
